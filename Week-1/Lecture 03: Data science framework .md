### Define the goal (HR problem or Issue)
Being very clear on this is very important because the
specific choices we make further on about data and tools
is fundamentally dependent on this.
If our questions are ill-conceived or not clearly
delineated, we may lose lot of time in subsequent steps
and achieve no value from this effort.

### Definition of HR problem should cover

- A statement of what
- A statement of why
- A statement of a desired state or outcome we are trying to achieve
- Example - Job classification / HR operations efficiency

### Definition of HR Problem: Enhancing HR Operations Efficiency with AI

#### What
The problem revolves around the inefficiency in HR operations, which includes cumbersome job classification, slow recruitment processes, and ineffective employee management. These inefficiencies lead to significant time and resource wastage, affecting overall organizational productivity and employee satisfaction.

#### Why
Inefficient HR operations can lead to delayed hiring, misclassified job roles, and inadequate employee management, resulting in decreased employee morale, higher turnover rates, and increased operational costs. Addressing these inefficiencies is crucial to maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring smooth business operations.

#### Desired State or Outcome
The desired state is to achieve streamlined HR operations through the implementation of AI-driven solutions. This includes automating job classification, accelerating recruitment processes, and enhancing employee management systems. The goal is to improve HR efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

#### Example
In the context of job classification, the desired outcome is to utilize AI algorithms to accurately classify job roles based on skills, experience, and industry standards. This will ensure the right candidates are matched with appropriate roles swiftly and effectively, improving the overall efficiency of the recruitment process and better alignment of job roles with organizational needs.

### Collect and manage data
HRMIS may be good source of HR data in any organization
In HRMIS data may not be in exact form in which we want it
Analytics and statics required to structure our data into the metric
(dependent variable or label) and the independent variables
(features)

To prepare our data set before the analysis, we
transform and load (ETL) Ensure data sources
should be trustworthy otherwise (garbage in
and garbage out)

### Metrics.
â€¢ Build the model
Input - our data
Processing step - Analytical tool - Descriptive, diagnostic,
predictive and prescriptive
Output - Statistical result


### Evaluate and critique the model
