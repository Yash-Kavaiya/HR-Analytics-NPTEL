## Introduction to HR analytics
• HR analytics
• People analytics
• Work force analytics

HR analytics can address various critical questions that help organizations make informed decisions about their workforce. Here’s how HR analytics can answer the following questions:

1. **What has happened?**
   - **Descriptive Analytics:** HR analytics can provide historical data analysis to describe past events. For example, it can show trends in employee turnover rates, hiring patterns, performance ratings, and training effectiveness. Reports and dashboards summarize these historical metrics.

2. **What is happening?**
   - **Diagnostic Analytics:** This involves real-time data analysis to understand current workforce conditions. For example, analytics tools can monitor current employee engagement levels, track ongoing recruitment efforts, or assess the current status of compliance with company policies.

3. **Where is it happening?**
   - **Location-based Analytics:** By analyzing data geographically, HR can identify where certain trends or issues are more prevalent. For instance, HR analytics can pinpoint locations with high turnover rates or low employee satisfaction, enabling targeted interventions.

4. **How is it happening?**
   - **Process Analytics:** This involves examining workflows and processes to understand how certain outcomes are achieved. For instance, analyzing the hiring process to determine how candidates progress through different stages and identifying bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

5. **What seems to be the underlying causes?**
   - **Root Cause Analysis:** Advanced analytics techniques, such as regression analysis or machine learning models, can help identify the root causes of specific HR issues. For example, analytics can reveal that low engagement is strongly correlated with a lack of career development opportunities or poor managerial support.

HR analytics combines data from various sources (e.g., HRIS, surveys, performance management systems) and uses statistical and machine learning techniques to provide these insights. This enables HR professionals to make data-driven decisions and implement strategies that improve overall organizational performance and employee well-being.

By using these visualization tools, organizations can gain deeper insights into their data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions more effectively.

### Diagnostic Analytics

Diagnostic analytics focuses on understanding the underlying reasons behind observed patterns and outcomes. It helps answer questions about why things happened and the relationships between different variables. Here are some key aspects of diagnostic analytics:

1. **Why did what we are observing occur?**
   - **Purpose:** To identify the root causes of observed phenomena or trends.
   - **Techniques:** Root cause analysis, drill-down analysis, and causal analysis.
   - **Example:** Investigating why there was a sudden increase in employee turnover in a particular quarter.

   - **Techniques:** R-squared (coefficient of determination) in regression analysis.
   - **Example:** Assessing how much of the variability in employee performance ratings can be explained by factors such as training, experience, and job role.

### Example Scenario in HR Analytics

**Context:** A company is experiencing a high turnover rate and wants to understand the underlying causes.

1. **Why did what we are observing occur?**
   - The analysis might reveal that the turnover spike is due to dissatisfaction with management, lack of career development opportunities, or inadequate compensation.

2. **Where did it occur?**
   - The analysis could show that turnover is particularly high in specific departments, such as the IT or Sales departments.

3. **Is the metric we are monitoring (dependent variable) related in any way to the other things that we have collected data for (independent variables)?**
   - The analysis might explore relationships between turnover rates (dependent variable) and factors like employee satisfaction, engagement scores, and training hours (independent variables).

4. **If so, what is the strength of that relationship?**
   - The analysis might find a strong negative correlation between employee satisfaction and turnover rates, indicating that lower satisfaction is associated with higher turnover.

5. **How much of the variability of our metric is accounted for from the data we have collected?**
   - The analysis might show that 60% of the variability in turnover rates can be explained by the factors considered (e.g., satisfaction, engagement, training), as indicated by an R-squared value of 0.60 in a regression model.

By leveraging diagnostic analytics, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving key metrics and take targeted actions to address underlying issues.

### Diagnostic Analytics Tools

### Difference Between MIS and Analytics

Management Information Systems (MIS) and Analytics serve different purposes within an organization, especially in the context of Human Resources (HR). Here’s a detailed comparison:

1. **Management Information Systems (MIS)**
   - **Purpose:** MIS is designed to provide routine information to managers and employees, helping them with day-to-day operations and decision-making.
   - **Function:** MIS collects, processes, and stores data to produce reports and summaries that support the management of an organization.
   - **Scope:** Typically focuses on the operational and tactical levels, providing historical data and basic reporting.
   - **Examples in HR:**
     - **HRMIS (Human Resource Management Information System):** Serves as the source of HR data. It includes modules for payroll, benefits administration, recruitment, training, performance management, and employee records.
     - **Reports:** Generates standard reports on recruitment effectiveness, training completion rates, attendance records, and performance evaluations.

2. **Analytics**
   - **Purpose:** Analytics involves the use of statistical, computational, and visualization techniques to derive insights from data, predict future trends, and make strategic decisions.
   - **Function:** Goes beyond routine reporting to analyze data, uncover patterns, and establish connections between HR processes and organizational performance.
   - **Scope:** Covers strategic levels, using advanced methods to inform long-term planning and decision-making.
   - **Examples in HR:**
     - **HR Analytics:** Uses data from HRMIS and other sources to provide deeper insights into HR functions. It can help predict future trends, identify the root causes of issues, and optimize HR strategies.
     - **Insights and Predictions:** Offers more than just metrics by connecting HR processes and decisions with organizational performance. For example, it can analyze the impact of training programs on employee productivity or predict turnover risks based on employee engagement scores.

### Summary

- **HRMIS (Part of MIS):**
  - **Source of Data:** HRMIS is the source of HR data, encompassing various metrics related to HR functions such as recruitment effectiveness, training effectiveness, and performance metrics.
  - **Operational Focus:** Primarily supports operational and tactical decision-making with routine reports and basic analysis.

- **HR Analytics:**
  - **Beyond Metrics:** Offers more than HR metrics by leveraging data to provide insights that connect HR processes and decisions with overall organizational performance.
  - **Strategic Role:** Elevates HRM to a strategic role, enabling HR to join other business functions at the strategy table by using data to inform long-term planning and decision-making.

### Example Scenario

**HRMIS:**
- **Function:** An HRMIS might generate a monthly report showing the number of new hires, training completion rates, and average performance ratings for employees.
- **Use Case:** A manager uses these reports to monitor day-to-day HR activities and ensure compliance with HR policies.

**HR Analytics:**
- **Function:** HR analytics might analyze the data from HRMIS and other sources to identify trends, such as which factors are most strongly associated with employee turnover or how training programs impact employee productivity.
- **Use Case:** A strategic HR leader uses these insights to develop targeted retention strategies, optimize training programs for better outcomes, and align HR initiatives with organizational goals.

By understanding the difference between MIS and analytics, organizations can better utilize their data to improve both operational efficiency and strategic decision-making.
